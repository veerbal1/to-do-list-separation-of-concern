# To-Do List App

Welcome to the To-Do List app! This app allows you to keep track of your tasks and stay organized, using the local storage of your browser.

## Goals

I built this app as a learning exercise to practice separation of concern and clean code practices. By separating the UI components from the main application logic, I was able to create a clear and maintainable codebase that is easy to understand and test.

## Implementation Details

The app uses a custom hook to manage the business logic for creating, updating, and deleting tasks, as well as storing the tasks in the local storage. This allows the UI components to focus on rendering the user interface and handling user interactions, without having to worry about the implementation details of the business logic.

## Feedback

I hope you find the app useful and that it helps you stay organized! If you have any feedback or suggestions, please don't hesitate to let me know.
